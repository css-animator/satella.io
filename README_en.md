# satella.io
 satella.io is a software who can bring life to your illustrations.
 At the moment, we are currently operating a web service on satella.io (http://satella.io)

The release is planned for the 1st of february 2018 (01/02/2018) but, i want to learn proprely WebGL so the release might be postponed.

If i can, i will keep updating the project for the sake of a good service.

※ We use a old version of Electron for the beta release.

## Setup
The project is on beta version so bugs might occur on the software. But, for people who want to try the software, please follow the instructions below.

#### clone
```
git clone https://github.com/yuki540net/satella.io.git && cd satella.io
```

#### yarn install
```
yarn install
```

#### start
```
yarn start
```
If you start the software, click to second button on your right and select the model_data folder of satella.io. With that in mind, you will be able to see the model of the character.

## The challenge to develop a "Live2D alike" software

Craft and make an open software who "brings life to illustrations" make me feels that for me, it is a good experience.

I've learned 3D modeling techniques from scratch so it seems rough but i hope that it brings me differents ways of making software.

satella.io is a web service which i will pursue the development

#### I expect that it evolves further.
